# Overview

I am trying to get a better undersrtanding of a variety of languages, which is why I chose to do this assignment in C++. I hadnt used this language for a few years and wanted to see what I could remember;

This software keeps track of multiple parties in DND as well as their Leaders. You can also alter different parts of the parties such as the member count.

I wrote this software because I enjoyed being able to do different things with Dungeons and Dragons and finding different uses in all the different languages.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio to complete this project.
I used C++ in this project, which is a language that specializes in data managment with memory.

# Useful Websites
